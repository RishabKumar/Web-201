### Techstack:
- npm, node.js, Webpack, React, Firebase, ES6, ESlint, jasmine, SASS, SEO Schema(RDFa, JSON-LD)

### Notes
- Please wait for images to load as they are served from firebase.
- Only images in viewport are loaded.
- Search suggestion works while typing in search box (try 'vegetarian' or 'chicken').
- Search section is populated when clicked on search button.
- SEO Schema is in 'RDFa' and 'json-LD' format.
- MenuSection schema is still in proposal so Google schema checker only reads menu-items for now.
- Cart page is in react so eslint shows some warnings in console.
- Package restore will take time! (Go grab a cup of coffee in the mean time)
- Cart is emptied when clicked on paytm or cash on delivery.
